## What is this book about?
Using a problem-solution-based approach, we'll show how you can automate all the boring stuff and let your computer do it for you instead of using the Python programming language. By the end of the book, you will have learned to identify problems and correct them to produce superior and reliable systems.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get to grips with scraping a website to detect changes
* Search and process raw sales files to aggregate information in spreadsheets
* Explore techniques to extract information from an Excel spreadsheet and generate exciting reports with graphs
* Discover the techniques required to generate random, print-friendly codes to be used  as single-use coupons
* Automatically generate a marketing campaign, contacting the recipients over different  channels
* Identify and implement precise solutions

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
# IMPORTS
from sale_log import SaleLog
def get_logs_from_file(shop, log_filename):
def main(log_dir, output_filename):
...
if __name__ == '__main__':
# PARSE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS AND CALL main()
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Before reading this book, readers need to know the basics of the Python language. We do not assume that the reader is an expert in the language.
The reader needs to know how to input commands in the command line (Terminal, Bash, or equivalent).
To understand the code in this book, you need a text editor, which will enable you to read and edit the code. You can use an IDE that supports the Python language, such as PyCharm and PyDevâ€”which you choose is up to you. Check out this link for ideas about
IDEs: https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book.
